INCIDENT DOT COM is an incident reporting app in it's simplest form. The ability to CRUD incident, attach status request, etc.

How to Run On LocalHost:
While in the Backend Directory, run "nodemon server.js". You should get a message in the terminal saying "MongoDb Connceted, Server is running on port 4800".
Then we switch to the FrontEnd Directory, ensure there are node_modules installed in the directory. If not run "npm i" then install angular cli using "npm install -g @angular/cli". After the installation then we run "ng serve". You should get a message saying " Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ \*\*".
